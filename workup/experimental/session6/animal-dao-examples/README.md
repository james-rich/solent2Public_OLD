# Project demonstrating various differnt DAO implmentations

This version of the project is begining to introduce SpringData as a framework on top of JPA.

The project now has 4 seperate DAO's which can work with the model
```
dao-simple
dao-json
dao-jaxb
dao-jdbc
dao-jpa
dao-springdata-jpa
```

Eclipselink is the JPA provider and Derby is used as the embedded database.


## running the application
As usual, build the whole project using 
```
mvn clean install
```
Then open the project and all its subprojects in Netbeans and run both the webfacadeexample2-web and webfacadeexample2-web-client projects in the embedded tomcat server.
